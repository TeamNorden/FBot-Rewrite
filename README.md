# **FBot**

##### *The most annoying bot on Discord, but it's rewritten*
## Full disclosure:
#### FBot is being rewritten in JavaScript with Discord.JS v13. This is for many reasons, but mainly to comply with the (unfortunate) everchanging requirements for verified bots on Discord. This rewrite is being lead by Codeize and helped by close friends of the developers. [Please contact us if you have any suggestions or concerns](https://fbot.breadhub.uk/support)


## Features
- **Lots of fun stuff**
 	- ***Message responses***, sort of our main feature, no big deal. The bot reads the magic json file and then it sends something to annoy you
 	- ***Counting*** Just count. All you do is count and compete against other servers. Make sure to not mess the number up
 	- ***Image processing*** commands to bonk yourself, bigpp your friends and trigger your enemies with more added regularly (sort of)
 	- ***Say commands***, force Fbot to say something for you
 	- ***Minigames!!!*** FBot currently has two minigames built into the DUI (**D**iscord **U**ser **I**nterface?) with more planned, and we'd love to hear what you would like to see!
- **Highly Customisable**
  - The S.P.A.M.S (**S**ophisticated **P**ersonalised **A**utomated **M**essaging **S**ystem) feature is set to off by default but can be toggled on individually in a channel when necessary (which is always, obviously)
  - ***Modes*** (the speak feature) changes how FBot talks, experience the uwu mode which does exactly what you wouldn't want it to do, pirate talk (arr), f^^k mode which appropriately adds said word into a sentence as many times as is grammatically possible, and much more!
  - ***Responds feature***, allows for less spam and use in more channels, by only responding to less common messages
  - As always ***customisable prefixes***, but we don't think you'll need it. fbot is the default prefix, no need to change it (hmm)
- **And more**
 	- FBot has a powerful snipe command (can retrieve up to 10 messages in a channel and hides messages deleted after say and purge)
 	- Lots of useful help, information and link commands
 	- Meta commands for version, uptime and usage stats to name a few
   - A lot of Typos!
